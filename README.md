1. Data Pre-processing:

    This is the initial step where raw data is cleaned, transformed, and organized to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. It 
  involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and any other necessary data manipulation.
  
2. Data Visualization:

    Using Python's visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn, you likely created charts and graphs to visually explore the
   characteristics of the e-commerce dataset. Visualization aids in understanding distributions, patterns, and relationships within the
   data.

3. Data Analysis:

    Conducting exploratory data analysis involves gaining insights into the dataset's structure, identifying trends, and understanding
   the relationships between different variables. This step helps in formulating hypotheses and guiding subsequent modeling decisions.

4. Machine Learning Model Training:

    1. Linear Regression: A model used for predicting a continuous target variable based on linear relationships with predictor variables.
    2. Decision Tree: A tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks, making decisions based on features.
    3. K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors): A non-parametric method for classification and regression that makes predictions based on the majority
   class or mean of the k-nearest data points.
    4. Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve overall predictive performance.

5. Predicting E-commerce Profit:

    Once the models are trained, they can be applied to new data to make predictions. In this case, you used the trained models to
   predict e-commerce profit based on the features present in the dataset.

6. Evaluation for Optimal Accuracy:

    After making predictions, the next step is to evaluate the performance of each model. Common metrics for regression tasks include
   Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. By comparing these metrics across the different models, you can
   identify which model performs optimally for predicting e-commerce profit.

7. Fine-tuning and Optimization:

    Depending on the evaluation results, you might perform hyperparameter tuning or consider feature engineering to enhance the models'
   performance. This iterative process aims to optimize the accuracy of the machine learning models.
